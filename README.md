# Camino de Santiago - Analyze the Pilgrimage

## About The Project

This repository is dedicated to the analysis of data on pilgrims traveling the Camino de Santiago over the past 20 years. The aim is to source, load (ETL), analyze, and visualize the data to uncover valuable insights into the trends and patterns of the pilgrimage.

The data for this project is sourced from the Pilgrim's Office in Santiago, which collects information from pilgrims arriving in Santiago and obtaining a Compostela. The data was accessible through an API until April 2023, but due to changes in the internal data management at the Pilgrim's Office, the database behind the API is no longer being updated.

## Repository Structure

- `data_extraction.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook that documents the process of fetching and cleaning the data using Python.
- `data/`: A directory containing the downloaded Excel and CSV files.
- `analysis/`: Directory with Tableau workbooks or other analysis tools used for data visualization.

## Technologies

- **Python**: For the ETL and data cleansing.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For documenting and executing the Python code.
- **Tableau Public**: For data analysis and visualization.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or newer
- Jupyter Notebook
- Tableau Public (or another BI software of your choice)

## Installation

Clone the repository and run the notebooks


## **Data Updates**

Since the API data is only available up to April 2023, no further automated updates will be conducted. Future data updates will need to be processed manually.
